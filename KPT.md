Day 01: 07/01/2018: I am expecting that I will finish the whole contents of the Dive for the first month. Also I think I need to have the time to learn what to learn from the job description point of view. I will make my task and schedule this week.  
Day 02: 07/02/2018: Both doing math and python programming is very good. I realized that I am in the very beginning part for those. However, I think my goal to be an engineer to create own algorithm. I need to say "コツコツとやるしかない、結果ではなく実績が大事。"
